# Zepto_Project

This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto â€” one of Indiaâ€™s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

  âœ… Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

  âœ… Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees
  
  âœ… Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

  âœ… Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more
